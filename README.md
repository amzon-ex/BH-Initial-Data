# Black Hole Initial Data

The code in this repo follows the code given with Baumgarte and Shapiro's book, *Numerical Relativity: Starting from Scratch* (2021). The original code can be found [here][nrcode].

The key changes involve adding angular momentum, extending to multiple BH, adding a contour plot option.
Optimization: (Disclaimer: The original code is not supposed to be an optimized code by design. It is meant to illustrate the method)
Using sparse matrices and a sparse solver with appropriate flags.

Better documentation and further improvements pending.
